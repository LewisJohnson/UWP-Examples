# Universal Windows app samples

This repo contains the samples that demonstrate the API usage patterns for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) in the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 10. These code samples were created with the Universal Windows templates available in Visual Studio, and are designed to run on desktop, mobile, and future devices that support the Universal Windows Platform.  

## Universal Windows Platform development

These samples require Visual Studio 2015 and the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 10 to build, test, and deploy your Universal Windows apps.
